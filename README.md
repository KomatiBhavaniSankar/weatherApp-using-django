Project Title: Weather Report Web Application

This web application provides real-time weather information for any city using data from the OpenWeather API. Built with Django as the back-end framework, the app handles user inputs and fetches weather data dynamically. The front-end interface is styled with Bootswatch for a clean and responsive design, alongside HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for enhanced interactivity. Users can search for current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed, with an easy-to-use interface that updates instantly.
